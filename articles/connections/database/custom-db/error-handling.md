# Custom Database Error Handling

There are three different errors you can return from a database connection:

* `new WrongUsernameOrPasswordError(<email or user_id>, <message>)`: when you know who the user is and want to keep track of a wrong password.
* `new ValidationError(<error code>, <message>)`: a generic error with an error code.
* `new Error(<message>)`: simple errors (no error code).

To return an error, call the callback with an error as the first parameter:

```js
callback(error);
```

For example:

```js
callback(new ValidationError('email-too-long', 'Email is too long.'));
```

If you use [Lock](/libraries/lock), you can customize the error messages that will be displayed by adding them to the dictionary. For more info, see [Customizing Lock Error Messages](libraries/lock/customizing-error-messages).
